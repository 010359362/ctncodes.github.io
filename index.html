    <h1>Hello World: I have returned to my website!</h1>
    <p>In case you likely forgot about me, world, I'm Chi Thien Nguyen. One of the traditional painters of art history. I'm also known by another name which I give myself. For instance,
      I call myself "Big Cheese" Chi Nguyen, believing that I would become the next Picasso in this world, mostly by reviving the old-fashion art of painting in today's time. To learn more,
      read my <a href="statement.html">artist's statement.</a></p>

      <h3>Disney's A Poem Is...: Love Edition, .mp4 video, 2018</h3>
      <p><i><b>A Poem Is...</b></i> is a mini-series featured on Disney Junior. The series consists of 21 retold classic poems read by celebrity guests. Each episode begins with
      several young children speaking about what they believe a poem is. The series' most notable feature, however, is that the clips are taken from classic and current Disney
      animated features and shorts. The series premiered February 14, 2011 when the Disney Junior block premiered. As for me, I took it upon myself to honor the memory of A Poem
      Is..., as I have created my own video where people are interviewed on what a poem is, and then a celebrity reads a famous poem to scenes from the Disney film canon.</p>
