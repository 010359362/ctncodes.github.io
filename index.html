      <h3>Disney's A Poem Is...: Love Edition, .mp4 video, 2018</h3>
      <p><i><b>A Poem Is...</b></i> is a mini-series featured on Disney Junior. The series consists of 21 retold classic poems read by celebrity guests. Each episode begins with 
      several young children speaking about what they believe a poem is. The series' most notable feature, however, is that the clips are taken from classic and current Disney 
      animated features and shorts. The series premiered February 14, 2011 when the Disney Junior block premiered. As for me, In honor and memory of the late Disney miniseries, 
      A Poem Is..., I have created my own video where people are interviewed on what a poem is, and then a celebrity reads a famous poem to scenes from the Disney film canon.</p>
