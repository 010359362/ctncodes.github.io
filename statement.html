  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p><h3>Adventurous Waters</h3> Techinical Process: Using a new deivce called a Zoom recorder, I recorded sounds my sinks and bathtub make when they are being filled up with and draining water. I made the visual aspect of my video using the same camera I typically use for photography class. I also recorded footage from Disney's Dumbo using liteCam on my laptop because I really wanted to work with ready-made footage. Once I got used to working on Premiere Pro, I even managed to provide beginning and ending credits for my video, like my teacher, Ms. Buckingham, wanted me to.</p>
  <p> Conceptual Process: When Intro to Digital Video began its first class sessions, I was naturally lost as to how to tackle my first video project. But then I got inspiration for my project on Video Art from <em>Tap Piece</em> by David Hall. That piece of Video Art simply showed a faucet filling up a clear container and then the container draining water. I wanted my video to have the same concept as <em>Tap Piece</em>, where active water is the star of the show.</p>
  <p><h3>Fate of the Circus</h3> Techinical Process: After piecing footage from movies, TV shows, and video games together, my first Fate of the Circus video just showed the Kongs fighting Pompy, followed by Dumbo, the Eds, and Mario truly succeeding Barnum's circus. But my teacher, at first, wasn't satisfied; she thought it could still use more sliced footage to avoid copyright infringement, and even a backstory explaining clearly why I made my video: to tell a story based on real events. So, between included news reports on the Barnum circus' decline, added text on my story, and my own narrative voiceover, I tried to give context to help people understand why cartoon characters are fighting in my video. Cartoon characters would battle each other to succeed Barnum and Bailey after its fate.</p>  
  <p> Conceptual Process: Not long into Intro to Digital Video, I was still thinking about the world's loss of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus back in 2017. My video would explain how once "The Greatest Show on Earth" was gone, a hero or villain would sooner or later take as the world's new leading entertainment act. And of course, the first person who considered succeeding Barnum was Pompy the Presumptuous, first boss of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze and Barnum's own circus rival. But once the heroic Donkey Kong and his family stopped Pompy, they happily established Dumbo the Flying Elephant as the new Circus World Leader.</p>
  <p><h3>See-saw of World Views</h3> Techinical Process: Clearly, my See-saw of World required getting help from my brother, Ti Nguyen, to code my see-saw. I also had to start using new apps, Atom and Github Desktop, to upload my interactive see-saw to my website. Github Desktop simply helped me to insert, retrieve and revise my data to make my web pages. Atom served as the workplace where Ti helped me code my balancing act into an actual web page. I would have used Adobe Dreamweaver for easier coding, but my teacher said that Dreamweaver just doesn't work well with Github.</p>  
  <p> Conceptual Process: Recently, I have been thinking to myself about how optimism and pessimism contrast one together, yet work together in duality. This philosophical concept is better expressed as heroes' hope vs villains' despair, or the classic question, "Is the glass half empty or half full?" As I brought up my thoughts to my teacher, Ms. Buckingham suggested that I balance both world views onto a moving see-saw to show this philosophy of mind in action. I took my teacher's see-saw advice to express my concern over philosophy ... and over coding too.</p>
  <p><h3>EYEWITNESS: Arctic & Antarctic - Extended Footage</h3> Techinical Process: Actually, I took the workplace for and progress on my Animated Title to Adobe After Effects instead of Adobe Premiere Pro. That attempt was made so I could  just keep the first six to seven seconds of the footage, the video's entire narration on migrating Emperor penguins, for my own compositon. More importantly still, I needed After Effects to help me animate my video's title more refinedly than just typical fades in and out of footage. The falling snowflakes were just added along to the video so I could show off (I had time for this).</p>
  <p> Conceptual Process: Not only was the Animated Title a minor project, but whether this is related or not, I also went through tragic events of my own. My Surface Pro 3 somehow "DIED' during my last videos' progress, and my dad blamed me for not taking his advice of backing up my data onto other devices. Now taking my Dad's advice in general, I kept my video's story and everything else simple. I just wanted to get my new <em>Extended Footage</em> over with.</p>
  <p><h3>Disney's A Poem Is...: Love Edition</h3> Techinical Process: The critique for <em>Fate of the Circus</em> apparently wasn't in my favor at first, but it still prompted me to get my final projects over with. So, except for Disney movie scenes (originally) and my classmates' interviews, I downloaded most of my footage from YouTube like I always do, to create one more collage video. Actually, I wanted to record Disney scenes from KissCartoon using liteCam to avoid copyright infringement, and because I could barely trust YouTube anymore for personal reasons. Alas, my liteCam recordings of Disney scenes were slow rather than rendered on Premiere Pro, even though I cut each scene down to the same time it takes to read verses of <em>How Do I Love Thee?</em>, and so I had no chance but to trust YouTube for supplying Disney footage again.</p>  
  <p> Conceptual Process: I wanted to return the favor to the Disney miniseries, <em>A Poem Is...</em>, for reviving my love for the Disney film canon and other media. I also noticed how underrated Sally Brown's reading of the poem, <em>How Do I Love Thee?</em>, really is, despite it appearing in the Valentine's day special, <em>Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown</em>. So as I worked out a video format, much shorter than my previous videos and based directly on that of <em>A Poem Is...</em>, I selected the following Disney films to be read to <em>How Do I Love Thee</em>: <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, and <em>The Lion King</em>. These Disney Golden Age and Renaissance films most demonstrate the theme of Browning's selected poem, love, and I already used <em>Dumbo</em> for my art before too.</p>
