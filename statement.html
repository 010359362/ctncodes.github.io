  <p><h3>See-saw of World Views</h3> Techinical Process: Clearly, my See-saw of World required me getting help from my brother, Ti Nguyen, to code my see-saw. This project also demanded that I start using new apps, Atom and Github Desktop, to actually upload my interactive see-saw to my website. Github Desktop simply helped me to insert, retrieve and revise my data for my website to register my pages. Atom served as the workplace where Ti helped me code my balancing act between world views into an acutal web page. I would have used Adobe Dreamweaver to code things more easily, but my teacher said that Dreamweaver just wasn't an option.</p>  
  <p> Conceptual Process: Recently, I have been thinking to myself about how optimism and pessimism contrast one together, yet work together in duality. This philosophical concept is better expressed as heroes' hope vs villains' despair, or the classic question, "Is the glass half empty or half full?" As I brought up my thoughts to my teacher, it was her suggetsion that I balance both world views onto a moving see-saw to prove the wonderful activity of this philosophy of mind. I took my teacher's advice and went ahead with the see-saw idea to express my concern over philosophy ... and over computer art too.</p>
