  <p><h3>See-saw of World Views</h3> Techinical Process: Clearly, my See-saw of World required me getting help from my brother, Ti Nguyen, to code my see-saw, setting, and balancing world views. This project also demanded that I start using new applications, Atom and Github Desktop, to actually upload my see-saw interaction to my website. Github Desktop simply helped me to retrieve my data already on my website, apply my changes to it, and put the data back into the website to register my pages. As for Atom, this application served as the workplace where Ti helped me code my balancing act between world views into an acutal web page.
